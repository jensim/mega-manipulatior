# Etsy/Hound search

Quick easy setup with docker!  
![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/etsy/hound?label=etsy%2Fhound%20version&sort=semver)  
No real *bells and whistles*.  
Takes some admin effort for every repo to be inserted in config.json, but that might not be an issue if you have a few huge mono-repos.

## Transfer search from sourcegraph to plugin
Copy and paste search string from search field. Basic search will be applied.
